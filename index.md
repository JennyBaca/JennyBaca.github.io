## Jenny Baca
I am a human geographer interested in the intersection of social inequalities and the environment. 
I have worked in Chile for over a decade, researching how forestry practices 
affect the political participation of different social groups. 
Through my engagement with Chile, I have come to understand that the meaning and practice of democracy 
is inseparable from environmental concerns. I bring that intellectual commitment to my teaching, 
drawing on political ecology and feminist geography to develop courses on environmental justice.
